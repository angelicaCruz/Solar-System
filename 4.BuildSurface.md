# Compiling Versions

## Surface Build
With the introduction of **Universal Windows Platform(UWP)**
any Windows-base device, such as PC, phone, tablet and Hololens,
can run UWP application.
This is why, we can also make a compiled version for Microsoft
Surface. 

The process is almost as the same as the Hololens build with
the smallest change on the settings. 

- Open **File->Build Settings**

*If you compiled a Hololens version before, the following two
  steps must already been made and when you open Build Settings 
  the selection is already on Windows Store.*
  
- Select **Windows Store** under Platform and press **Switch**
  **Platform**.
