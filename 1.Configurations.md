## Configuration: Files
- Go to Unity. 
- Find **Assets->Streaming Assets**.

</p>

- Edit file and make sure that **Server_Host** value is 
  the same as the **Service IP** provided by MeshExpert Center.
- Add **Server_Port = 8848** if your file doesn't have it.

</p>

- Save the changes and close file.
  The file you've just modified is very important as it will
  determine the the success of communication between devices
  and server.
  
- If you want proof that your server is working and that your
  MEConfigNetwork.ini contains the right information, Play your 
  scene in Unity. 
  Focus on the **Console** and its data. 
- If config file is right, **Delay** value is not zero and additional
  information as the picture shown below.

</p>

- If config file is not right, you will only see **Delay=0** as 
  shown in the picture below.

**Config file needs to contain the right Server Host address. As
mentioned before, it will determine the success of the communication
between devices. Have in mind that config file will be the same for 
every device so you don't have to configure every time you make a 
compiled version for a specific device.**

**Remember:** If app is running on Unity Editor or PC Standalone, you 
           can modify config file directly in **StreamingAssets** folder. 
           Otherwise, you need to find it in the **PersistentDataPath** 
           because if the application is **not** running on UnityEditor
           or PCStandalone, when the app starts for the first time, the
           config file is automatically copied to PersistentDataPAth
           directory and later on, the app will load the configurations 
           from that directory.            
           For more information about **PersistentDataPath**, please
           refer to Unity document: [Application.persistentDataPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html)
