##Let's see SolarSystem Explorer!

We previously made two versions of our SolarSystem: 
PC and Hololens versions. We also deployed our Solar
System Explorer on our device. 

All we have to do now is to see the two version work 
and especially, work together. 

Open you Solar System Explorer PC version and Play it. 

Get your Hololens and run the Solar System Explorer
you deployed previously. 
Wait for it to start on Hololens. 

If you've done things correctly, you must be able to 
interact with the application on Hololens and see your
movement on your PC version and vice versa. 

And that's it! You have an application with Collaboration
Module working. 

You can now share your holographic experience with other
users!!
